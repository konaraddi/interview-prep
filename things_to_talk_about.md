# Things to Talk About

Things to _potentially_ bring up in an interview in addition to the details on a resume. This page excludes what's already on the resume.

## What have I done

### web-riimote

- Trending on several subreddits including r/javascript, r/node, r/programming
- Received messages from people saying they didn't know such a thing was possible
- Applications include smart TVs, games, and interactive educational experiences
- Over 2,000 unique visitors

### Tutorial for https://vuejs.org

- Wrote a tutorial on building desktop apps with Electron and Vue for the official Vue.js documentation site
- Pending review by engineer at Microsoft

### SocialSpend

- Built web and augmented reality apps using a banking API to visualize nearby friends’ transactions
- Built at CapitalOne Engineering Summit Hackathon
- Node, Firebase, Nessie API, Google Places API
- At the summit I learned about AWS, building chatbots with Dialogflow, native Android and iOS app development, and machine learning

### c1-airbnb

- Winning submission for CapitalOne SWE Winter Challenge
- Most submissions used a server because they gave us a lot of data in CSV format. I was doing this at first too but the only free hosting provider was Heroku and it was too slow to load. So I did something a bit different; I cut the CSV file down to just the data I was using then parsed the CSV in real time on the front end. My app loaded faster than those using Heroku and I could host it on Github Pages because it was a static website.
- People messaged me about my submission asking for advice and help with their submission for the next summit
- A stranger messaged me on LinkedIn asking for help with their first round assessment for a full time position at CapitalOne

### Over Sand Vehicle

- Helped build it, not just program it
- Helped design the vehicle and what parts to purchase

### ACES Honeypot

- One time, we couldn't SSH into our own honeypots because a hacker got in and deleted everything including the logs
  - We wrote scripts to recycle the containers so setting things up would be faster should it happen again but we didn't know what changes to make because we didn't know what the hacker did. Luckily, the hacker never came back.
- I `sudo rm -rf /*`ed away my VM and learned never to copy + paste commands you don’t understand

### Tech talk on building chrome extensions

- Created slides and a tutorial for delivering a tech talk
- Delivered a tech talk to over 50 students
- At the end of the talk, almost everyone had a chrome extension. There were a couple people who had trouble but worked with them after the presentation to fix their issues.
- Everyone left with a chrome extension that takes notes on a per-website-basis

### Android app development

- Built Android apps that revamp the device's UI
- Over 4,300 monthly active users and 46,000 downloads
