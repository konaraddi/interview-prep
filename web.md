# Web

## HTTP vs HTTP 2.0

HTTP/2 improves upon HTTP:
* compress headers
* send multiple requests and receive multiple responses on the same connection
* server can push to client

## HTTPS vs HTTP

* HTTPS - encrypted communication between client and server
* By default, HTTPS runs on port 443 and HTTP runs on port 80
